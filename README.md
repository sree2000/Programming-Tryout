# Programming-Tryout
2017 Tryouts
  Programming is one of the most fun sub teams on robotics. You have to use your brain and logic to solve problems which I love to do. Programming is one of my most favorite classes in school and I get to spend a lot of time with my friends. The most exciting part of this year it the autonomous potential in our robot. This could really be the year where we get serious autonomous points and get many more points scoring using computers instead of relying on humans. Every year we find new challenges and a way to get better. That is one of the mot exciting part of programing, how fast we get better, realize our mistakes, and correct them for next year so they wouldnâ€™t happen again. I want this year to be the year we win a regional and get to internationals as team captains and get picked by an alliance or be a captain in internationals.  The code and process improve every year and we tend not to make mistakes twice. Last year we had pairing problems with the field and bad hardware which I helped fix, this year there will be new problems and I think I can help fix them.
